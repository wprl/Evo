The only external thing needed to build this is ant, which is available from apt-get.

To build: 

ant jar

To run:

cd dist
java -jar assignment1a.jar [--config <configfile>]

The Solution.randomize() method is a bit hairy, but I wanted it to be truly random, so I hope you can forgive the bit hacking :)
