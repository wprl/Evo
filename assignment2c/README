The only external thing needed to build this is ant, which is available from apt-get.

To build: 

ant jar

To run:

java -jar assignment2c.jar [--config <configfile>]

css-1.cfg 		   configuration for coevolutionary sampling size of 1
css-10.cfg 		   configuration for coevolutionary sampling size of 10
css-20.cfg 		   configuration for coevolutionary sampling size of 20
css-1-log.txt	  	   log for css-1 experiment
css-10-log.txt	  	   log for css-10 experiment
css-20-log.txt	  	   log for css-20 experiment
css-1-solution.txt	   solution for css-1 experiment 
css-10-solution.txt	   solution for css-10 experiment 
css-20-solution.txt	   solution for css-20 experiment 
css-1-chart.pdf		   graph of fitness vs. evals for css-1
css-10-chart.pdf	   graph of fitness vs. evals for css-10
css-20-chart.pdf	   graph of fitness vs. evals for css-20
analysis.csv		   t-tests comparing each experiment

I attempted a cycle prevention algorithm (it can be enabled in the config file).
This algorithm saves a copy of the best individual from each generation after
survival selection.  These individuals are then added to the pool of opponents
from which the relative fitness algorithm draws its samples..
